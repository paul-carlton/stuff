**Paul Carlton**: What are 5 creative things I could do with my kids' art? I don't want to throw them away, but it's also so much clutter.

**ChatGPT**: That’s a great idea! Kids’ artwork is special, but it can pile up fast. Here are five creative ways to repurpose it:  

1. **Make a Rotating Art Gallery** – Use a large frame with strings and clothespins or a magnetic board to display a rotating selection of their artwork. This keeps things fresh and reduces clutter.  

2. **Create Custom Wrapping Paper** – Use their drawings as wrapping paper for gifts. It adds a personal touch and makes presents even more meaningful.  

3. **Turn Art into Greeting Cards** – Cut and fold their artwork into homemade cards for birthdays, thank-you notes, or holidays. Grandparents and friends will love them!  

4. **Make a Digital Scrapbook** – Scan or take photos of their best pieces and create a digital album or a printed photo book. This preserves their creativity without taking up space
