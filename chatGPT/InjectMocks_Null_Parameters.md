**Paul Carlton**: When I use InjectMocks all the parameters passed to constructor are null

**ChatGPT**: It sounds like you're using `@InjectMocks` from Mockito, but the constructor dependencies are not being injected properly. Here are a few things to check:

### 1. Ensure Dependencies are Mocked
Mockito injects mocks into `@InjectMocks`, but you need to explicitly declare them with `@Mock` or `@Spy`:

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) // If using JUnit 5
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private Dependency1 dependency1;

    @Mock
    private Dependency2 dependency2;

    @InjectMocks
    private MyService myService;

    // Tests go here
}
```

If `dependency1` and `dependency2` are not mocked, Mockito will inject `null`.

### 2. Are You Using `MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this)`?
If you're using JUnit 4, you need to initialize mocks manually in `@Before`:

```java
@Before
public void setUp() {
    MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this);
}
```

For JUnit 5, use `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` instead.

### 3. Ensure Constructor Injection is Used
Mockito injects dependencies via constructor, setters, or field injection. If your class only has a constructor, it should look something like this:

```java
public class MyService {
    private final Dependency1 dependency1;
    private final Dependency2 dependency2;

    public MyService(Dependency1 dependency1, Dependency2 dependency2) {
        this.dependency1 = dependency1;
        this.dependency2 = dependency2;
    }
}
```

If Mockito cannot find a matching constructor, it might inject `null`.

### 4. Conflicts with Other Frameworks
If you're using Spring (without `@MockBean`), or another DI framework, ensure it’s not interfering with Mockito.

---

If you're still facing issues, let me know how your class is structured and how you set up your test.

**Paul Carlton**: You haven't provided the instance at field declaration so I tried to construct the instance

**ChatGPT**: If you manually instantiate the class with `new`, Mockito will **not** inject mocks into it. Mockito only injects mocks into objects it creates itself.  

For example, this will **not** work:  

```java
@InjectMocks
private MyService myService = new MyService(dependency1, dependency2); // ❌ Wrong
```

### Correct Approach  
Let Mockito handle the instantiation:  

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) // For JUnit 5
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private Dependency1 dependency1;

    @Mock
    private Dependency2 dependency2;

    @InjectMocks
    private MyService myService; // Mockito will automatically call the constructor

}
```

### Why?  
Mockito will detect `@InjectMocks` and try to create an instance of `MyService` using available `@Mock` fields. If you instantiate `MyService` manually, Mockito has no way to inject the mocks before the constructor is called, so dependencies remain `null`.

**Paul Carlton**: But how do I set the values of constructor parameters 

**ChatGPT**: When you use `@InjectMocks`, Mockito automatically injects the `@Mock` instances into the constructor parameters. You don't need to manually pass values; Mockito does it for you.  

However, if you need to control the values returned by the mocked dependencies, you can use `when(...).thenReturn(...)` to define mock behavior.  

---

### Example: Setting Constructor Parameter Values  

#### **1. Class to Test**  
```java
public class MyService {
    private final Dependency1 dependency1;
    private final Dependency2 dependency2;

    public MyService(Dependency1 dependency1, Dependency2 dependency2) {
        this.dependency1 = dependency1;
        this.dependency2 = dependency2;
    }

    public String doSomething() {
        return dependency1.getData() + " " + dependency2.getData();
    }
}
```

#### **2. Test with Mocks Injected**  
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) // For JUnit 5
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private Dependency1 dependency1;

    @Mock
    private Dependency2 dependency2;

    @InjectMocks
    private MyService myService; // Automatically constructed with mocks

    @Test
    void testDoSomething() {
        // Define what mock methods return
        when(dependency1.getData()).thenReturn("Hello");
        when(dependency2.getData()).thenReturn("World");

        // Call the method and verify behavior
        String result = myService.doSomething();
        assertEquals("Hello World", result);
    }
}
```

---

### Key Points  
1. **Mockito automatically injects mocks into the constructor** of `MyService` when you use `@InjectMocks`.  
2. **You don’t need to manually pass constructor parameters**—just annotate dependencies with `@Mock`.  
3. **Use `when(...).thenReturn(...)` to control mock behavior** and simulate real dependencies.  

Let me know if you need further clarification!

**Paul Carlton**: I need to set parameters passed to the constructor of class under test, i .e. 

@InjectMocks
    private MyService myService; // Automatically constructed with mocks

I need it to call myService constructor with values I set

**ChatGPT**: If you need to **manually set specific constructor parameters** while still using `@InjectMocks`, Mockito does not provide a direct way to do this. However, you have a few alternatives:

---

## **Option 1: Use a Custom Constructor Call (Recommended)**
Instead of `@InjectMocks`, manually instantiate `MyService` and pass your desired values.

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private Dependency1 dependency1;

    @Mock
    private Dependency2 dependency2;

    private MyService myService; // No @InjectMocks

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        myService = new MyService(dependency1, dependency2); // Pass values manually
    }

    @Test
    void testDoSomething() {
        when(dependency1.getData()).thenReturn("Hello");
        when(dependency2.getData()).thenReturn("World");

        String result = myService.doSomething();
        assertEquals("Hello World", result);
    }
}
```
### Why?
- **Gives full control** over constructor parameters.
- Avoids relying on Mockito's automatic injection.
- Works for any combination of real values and mocks.

---

## **Option 2: Use `Mockito.spy()` for Partial Injection**
If you want to **inject some mocks** but still **control constructor arguments**, use `spy()`.

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private Dependency1 dependency1;

    @Mock
    private Dependency2 dependency2;

    private MyService myService;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        myService = spy(new MyService(dependency1, dependency2));
    }
}
```
### When to Use?
- When you want to **mock some methods** but still call the real constructor.
- Useful when `MyService` has logic in the constructor that you don’t want to mock.

---

## **Option 3: Use `@InjectMocks` with `@Spy` for Partial Real Values**
You can also use `@Spy` instead of `@Mock` if you want to **inject a real instance instead of a mock**.

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MyServiceTest {

    @Spy
    private Dependency1 dependency1 = new Dependency1("Custom Value");

    @Mock
    private Dependency2 dependency2;

    @InjectMocks
    private MyService myService; // dependency1 uses a real instance
}
```
### When to Use?
- When you want **one real instance** but **mock the rest**.
- Works when `Dependency1` has complex setup logic.

---

## **Final Recommendation**
If you want **full control over constructor parameters**, **Option 1** (manual instantiation) is the cleanest and most flexible approach. `@InjectMocks` is useful **only when you want automatic injection** with mocks.

**Paul Carlton**: But my constructor has parameters …

   @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        myService = spy(new MyService(“a value”, dependency1, dependency2));
    }
}

Will this work?

**ChatGPT**: Yes, your approach **will work** if your constructor takes a mix of real values and mocks. The key is that you're manually creating the instance of `MyService`, which ensures that the constructor is called with the values you specify.  

---

## **How Your Code Works**
```java
@BeforeEach
void setUp() {
    myService = spy(new MyService("a value", dependency1, dependency2));
}
```
- `"a value"` → Passed **directly** as a real value.  
- `dependency1` & `dependency2` → Injected as **mocked** instances.  
- `spy(...)` → Wraps `MyService` so that you can **mock some methods** if needed.

---

## **When to Use `spy()`?**
Using `spy()` is useful **if you want to mock some methods of `MyService`** while keeping the real constructor.  

Example:
```java
doReturn("Mocked Response").when(myService).someMethod();
```
This will **override `someMethod()`** while keeping the rest of `MyService` real.

---

## **If You Don’t Need to Mock Methods in `MyService`**
If you don't plan to mock any methods in `MyService`, you **don't need `spy()`**. Just use a direct instantiation:

```java
@BeforeEach
void setUp() {
    myService = new MyService("a value", dependency1, dependency2);
}
```

This is **cleaner** if you don't need to mock `MyService` itself.

---

### **TL;DR**
✅ **Yes, your approach will work.**  
- Use `spy(new MyService(...))` **only if you need to mock some methods of `MyService`**.  
- Otherwise, just instantiate `MyService` directly.

**Paul Carlton**: What about a class where I’m not passing independencies as constructor parameters but those dependencies are set as class variables which call the dependency? Co constructor when they’re defined?

**ChatGPT**: If your dependencies are **not passed via the constructor** but are instead initialized **inside the class**, Mockito's `@InjectMocks` won't work properly because it only injects dependencies through **constructor, setters, or field injection**.  

In your case, the dependencies are being **instantiated within the class itself**, which makes them **hard to mock**.  

---

## **Example of a Problematic Class**
```java
public class MyService {

    private Dependency1 dependency1 = new Dependency1(); // Hardcoded instantiation
    private Dependency2 dependency2 = new Dependency2();

    public String doSomething() {
        return dependency1.getData() + " " + dependency2.getData();
    }
}
```
### **Why This is a Problem**
- Mockito **cannot replace `dependency1` and `dependency2`** because they are created **inside the class**.
- Even if you use `@InjectMocks`, Mockito cannot override those dependencies.

---

## **How to Fix It**
### **Option 1: Use Constructor Injection (Best Practice)**
Instead of instantiating dependencies inside the class, **pass them via the constructor**:

```java
public class MyService {
    private final Dependency1 dependency1;
    private final Dependency2 dependency2;

    public MyService(Dependency1 dependency1, Dependency2 dependency2) {
        this.dependency1 = dependency1;
        this.dependency2 = dependency2;
    }

    public String doSomething() {
        return dependency1.getData() + " " + dependency2.getData();
    }
}
```
#### **Test: Now You Can Use Mocks!**
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private Dependency1 dependency1;

    @Mock
    private Dependency2 dependency2;

    @InjectMocks
    private MyService myService; // Mockito will inject mocks

    @Test
    void testDoSomething() {
        when(dependency1.getData()).thenReturn("Hello");
        when(dependency2.getData()).thenReturn("World");

        String result = myService.doSomething();
        assertEquals("Hello World", result);
    }
}
```
✅ **Mockito now works because it can inject mocks via the constructor.**

---

### **Option 2: Use Setter Injection**
If you **cannot modify the constructor**, you can use **setters** instead:

```java
public class MyService {
    private Dependency1 dependency1 = new Dependency1();
    private Dependency2 dependency2 = new Dependency2();

    public void setDependency1(Dependency1 dependency1) {
        this.dependency1 = dependency1;
    }

    public void setDependency2(Dependency2 dependency2) {
        this.dependency2 = dependency2;
    }

    public String doSomething() {
        return dependency1.getData() + " " + dependency2.getData();
    }
}
```
#### **Test: Manually Inject Mocks Using Setters**
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private Dependency1 dependency1;

    @Mock
    private Dependency2 dependency2;

    private MyService myService;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        myService = new MyService();
        myService.setDependency1(dependency1); // Manually inject mocks
        myService.setDependency2(dependency2);
    }
}
```
✅ **Works, but constructor injection is better.**

---

### **Option 3: Use Reflection to Inject Mocks (Not Recommended)**
If you **cannot modify the class** and it **doesn’t have setters**, you can use **reflection**:

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private Dependency1 dependency1;

    @Mock
    private Dependency2 dependency2;

    private MyService myService;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() throws Exception {
        myService = new MyService();

        Field field1 = MyService.class.getDeclaredField("dependency1");
        field1.setAccessible(true);
        field1.set(myService, dependency1);

        Field field2 = MyService.class.getDeclaredField("dependency2");
        field2.setAccessible(true);
        field2.set(myService, dependency2);
    }
}
```
✅ **Works as a last resort, but avoid it if possible.**

---

### **Best Approach**
- ✅ **If you can modify the class → Use Constructor Injection (Option 1).**
- ✅ **If the class already exists and you can add methods → Use Setter Injection (Option 2).**
- ❌ **If you can’t modify the class at all → Use Reflection (Option 3, last resort).**

Let me know if you need help applying this!

**Paul Carlton**: Using java org.mockito I need to mock a private method of the class under test that is called in the constructor

**ChatGPT**: Mocking a **private method** that is called **inside the constructor** using Mockito is tricky because Mockito **does not support direct private method mocking**. However, there are workarounds depending on your situation.  

---

## **Option 1: Refactor to Avoid Mocking the Private Method (Best Practice)**
Instead of mocking private methods, **extract the logic into a separate dependency** so that you can mock it easily.

### **Example Before Refactoring (Problematic)**
```java
public class MyService {

    public MyService() {
        String value = initValue(); // Private method called in constructor
        System.out.println("Initialized with value: " + value);
    }

    private String initValue() {
        return "real value";
    }
}
```
- **Problem:** `initValue()` is private and called inside the constructor, making it hard to mock.

### **After Refactoring (Dependency Injection)**
```java
public class MyService {

    private final ValueInitializer valueInitializer;

    public MyService(ValueInitializer valueInitializer) {
        this.valueInitializer = valueInitializer;
        String value = valueInitializer.initValue(); // Call injected dependency
        System.out.println("Initialized with value: " + value);
    }
}
```
Now you can **mock `ValueInitializer`** easily in the test:
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private ValueInitializer valueInitializer;

    private MyService myService;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        when(valueInitializer.initValue()).thenReturn("mocked value");
        myService = new MyService(valueInitializer);
    }
}
```
✅ **Now we can mock the behavior easily!**

---

## **Option 2: Use PowerMock (If You Can’t Modify the Code)**
Mockito **does not support** private method mocking, but **PowerMockito** (an extension of Mockito) does. If you **must** mock a private method, use `PowerMockito.spy()`.

### **Example Using PowerMockito**
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
import org.mockito.MockedStatic;
import org.mockito.Mockito;
import org.powermock.core.classloader.annotations.PrepareForTest;
import org.powermock.modules.junit.jupiter.PowerMockExtension;

import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

@ExtendWith(PowerMockExtension.class)
@PrepareForTest(MyService.class) // Required for private method mocking
class MyServiceTest {

    private MyService myService;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() throws Exception {
        myService = Mockito.spy(new MyService());

        // Mock private method
        doReturn("mocked value").when(myService, "initValue");
    }

    @Test
    void testConstructor() {
        // Test code that verifies behavior
    }
}
```
❗ **PowerMock is powerful but should be used only as a last resort.**  
✅ **Works when modifying the class is not an option.**  
❌ **Slower and less maintainable than proper refactoring.**  

---

### **Conclusion**
1. ✅ **Best approach:** **Refactor the private method into a separate dependency** so it can be injected and mocked normally.  
2. ❌ **Use PowerMock only if necessary** (e.g., legacy code where you **cannot refactor**).  

Would you be able to refactor your class, or are you stuck with existing code?

**Paul Carlton**: What is the best practise for testing and mocking private methods of a class

**ChatGPT**: ### **Best Practices for Testing and Mocking Private Methods in Java**  

Mocking private methods is usually **not recommended** because it often indicates that the class is tightly coupled or doing too much. Instead, the best practice is to **avoid the need to mock private methods altogether**. Here’s how:  

---

## ✅ **Best Practice 1: Test the Public Methods Instead**  
Private methods should generally **not be tested directly**. Instead, test the **public methods** that call those private methods.  

### **Example: Testing via Public Methods**  
#### **Class Under Test (No Need to Mock `calculateTax`)**
```java
public class OrderService {
    public double getFinalPrice(double price) {
        double tax = calculateTax(price);
        return price + tax;
    }

    private double calculateTax(double price) {
        return price * 0.1;
    }
}
```
#### **Test Class**
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class OrderServiceTest {

    private final OrderService orderService = new OrderService();

    @Test
    void testGetFinalPrice() {
        double result = orderService.getFinalPrice(100);
        assertEquals(110, result);
    }
}
```
✅ **Why?**  
- The private method `calculateTax` is **already tested indirectly** via `getFinalPrice()`.  
- No need for private method mocking.  

---

## ✅ **Best Practice 2: Extract Private Methods into a Separate Dependency**  
If a private method contains **business logic** that needs to be mocked, move it to a separate **injectable service** so it can be easily mocked.  

### **Before Refactoring (Difficult to Mock)**
```java
public class OrderService {
    public double getFinalPrice(double price) {
        double tax = calculateTax(price);
        return price + tax;
    }

    private double calculateTax(double price) {
        return price * 0.1;
    }
}
```
### **After Refactoring (Easier to Mock)**
```java
public class TaxCalculator {
    public double calculateTax(double price) {
        return price * 0.1;
    }
}

public class OrderService {
    private final TaxCalculator taxCalculator;

    public OrderService(TaxCalculator taxCalculator) {
        this.taxCalculator = taxCalculator;
    }

    public double getFinalPrice(double price) {
        double tax = taxCalculator.calculateTax(price);
        return price + tax;
    }
}
```
#### **Now, You Can Mock TaxCalculator!**
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class OrderServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private TaxCalculator taxCalculator;

    @InjectMocks
    private OrderService orderService;

    @Test
    void testGetFinalPrice() {
        when(taxCalculator.calculateTax(100)).thenReturn(5.0);
        assertEquals(105, orderService.getFinalPrice(100));
    }
}
```
✅ **Now you can mock the logic without touching private methods.**  

---

## ❌ **Last Resort: Mock Private Methods (Not Recommended)**
If you **absolutely must** mock a private method (e.g., for legacy code), use **PowerMockito**.  

### **Example: Using PowerMockito to Mock a Private Method**
```java
@ExtendWith(PowerMockExtension.class)
@PrepareForTest(OrderService.class)
class OrderServiceTest {

    private OrderService orderService;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() throws Exception {
        orderService = spy(new OrderService());

        doReturn(5.0).when(orderService, "calculateTax", 100.0);
    }

    @Test
    void testGetFinalPrice() throws Exception {
        assertEquals(105, orderService.getFinalPrice(100));
    }
}
```
❗ **Use this approach only for legacy code when refactoring is not an option.**  

---

### **Final Recommendation**  
✔ **Best Approach:** Test private methods **indirectly** by testing the public methods that call them.  
✔ **Good Approach:** Extract private methods into **separate dependencies** (e.g., services) so they can be mocked.  
❌ **Last Resort:** Use **PowerMockito** to mock private methods **only if refactoring is impossible**.  

Would you be able to refactor your code, or are you dealing with legacy code that can't be changed?

**Paul Carlton**: java unit test best practice for testing private methods

**ChatGPT**: ## **Best Practices for Testing Private Methods in Java Unit Tests**  

When writing unit tests, the **best practice is to avoid testing private methods directly**. Instead, you should test the **public methods that use those private methods**. However, there are situations where you might need to test private methods, especially when dealing with **legacy code**.  

Here are the best practices and possible approaches:

---

## ✅ **Best Practice 1: Test Private Methods Indirectly via Public Methods (Recommended)**
Private methods should usually be tested **indirectly** through the public methods that call them.  

### **Example: Class with a Private Method**
```java
public class Calculator {

    public int addAndDouble(int a, int b) {
        int sum = add(a, b);
        return sum * 2;
    }

    private int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```
### **Test Case (Testing via Public Method)**
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class CalculatorTest {

    private final Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

    @Test
    void testAddAndDouble() {
        int result = calculator.addAndDouble(2, 3);
        assertEquals(10, result);  // (2 + 3) * 2 = 10
    }
}
```
✅ **Why is this the best practice?**  
- The private method `add()` is **implicitly tested** through `addAndDouble()`.  
- The test remains **maintainable** and **less coupled** to implementation details.  

---

## ✅ **Best Practice 2: Extract Private Methods to a Separate Class**
If a private method has **complex logic**, move it to a **separate helper or service class**.  

### **Example: Refactoring to a Separate Class**
```java
public class MathHelper {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Calculator {
    private final MathHelper mathHelper;

    public Calculator(MathHelper mathHelper) {
        this.mathHelper = mathHelper;
    }

    public int addAndDouble(int a, int b) {
        int sum = mathHelper.add(a, b);
        return sum * 2;
    }
}
```
### **Test (Now We Can Mock `MathHelper`)**
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class CalculatorTest {

    @Mock
    private MathHelper mathHelper;

    @InjectMocks
    private Calculator calculator;

    @Test
    void testAddAndDouble() {
        when(mathHelper.add(2, 3)).thenReturn(5);
        assertEquals(10, calculator.addAndDouble(2, 3));
    }
}
```
✅ **Why is this better?**  
- Now we can **mock** `MathHelper` instead of dealing with private methods.  
- The test is **easier to maintain** and follows the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.  

---

## ❌ **Last Resort: Use Reflection to Test Private Methods**
If you cannot modify the code (e.g., testing **legacy code**), you can use **reflection** to access private methods.  

### **Example: Testing a Private Method Using Reflection**
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class CalculatorTest {

    @Test
    void testPrivateMethod() throws Exception {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        
        // Use reflection to access the private method
        Method method = Calculator.class.getDeclaredMethod("add", int.class, int.class);
        method.setAccessible(true);  // Allow access to private method

        int result = (int) method.invoke(calculator, 2, 3);
        assertEquals(5, result);
    }
}
```
✅ **When to use this?**  
- **Only when modifying the code is not possible** (e.g., legacy or third-party code).  
❌ **Why is this not recommended?**  
- Reflection makes tests **fragile** and dependent on implementation details.  
- If the private method is renamed or changed, the test **breaks unnecessarily**.  

---

## **Final Recommendation**
### **✅ Best Practices (Preferred Approach)**
✔ **Test private methods indirectly** through public methods (**Best Approach**).  
✔ **Extract private logic into a separate class** so it can be tested normally (**Refactor When Possible**).  
✔ **Use dependency injection** for testable and maintainable code.  

### **❌ When to Use Workarounds (Only for Legacy Code)**
⚠ **Reflection can be used for legacy code** but should be avoided in new code.  
⚠ **PowerMockito can mock private methods** but is a last resort for unmodifiable code.  

Would you be able to refactor your code, or are you working with legacy code that can't be changed?

When a class under test calls methods of **other objects inside its constructor**, Mockito **cannot** automatically mock these calls unless the dependencies are properly injected.  

Here’s how you can handle this situation:  

---

## ✅ **Best Practice: Use Constructor Injection for Dependencies**  

The best way to mock calls to other objects in the constructor is to **use dependency injection** and then mock those dependencies in the test.  

### **Example: Class Under Test (With Injected Dependencies)**
```java
public class MyService {
    private final Dependency1 dependency1;
    private final Dependency2 dependency2;

    public MyService(Dependency1 dependency1, Dependency2 dependency2) {
        this.dependency1 = dependency1;
        String result = dependency1.getData();  // External call in constructor
        dependency2.process(result);
    }
}
```
### **Test: Mock Dependencies Passed to Constructor**
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private Dependency1 dependency1;

    @Mock
    private Dependency2 dependency2;

    private MyService myService;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        when(dependency1.getData()).thenReturn("mocked data");

        myService = new MyService(dependency1, dependency2);

        // Verify that methods were called in the constructor
        verify(dependency1).getData();
        verify(dependency2).process("mocked data");
    }
}
```
✅ **Now the dependencies are mocked, and constructor calls are tested.**

## ❌ **What If You Can’t Modify the Constructor?**  

If you cannot inject dependencies because the class creates them **internally**, Mockito cannot mock them. You have two options:  

### **Option 1: Use Spy and `doReturn()` (If You Can Partially Mock the Class)**
If you can **partially mock** the class, you can use `spy()` to override method calls.  

```java
class MyService {
    private Dependency1 dependency1 = new Dependency1();  // Hardcoded instance

    public MyService() {
        String result = dependency1.getData();  // External call in constructor
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}
```
### **Test Using Spy**
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private Dependency1 dependency1;

    private MyService myService;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        myService = spy(new MyService());

        doReturn("mocked data").when(myService).dependency1.getData();

        // Verify that dependency1.getData() was called
        verify(myService.dependency1).getData();
    }
}
```
❌ **Why is this bad?**  
- **Relies on implementation details.**  
- **Does not work if dependency1 is private and final.**  
- **May not work for some frameworks (e.g., Spring’s final beans).**  

---

### **Option 2: Use Reflection (If You Can’t Modify the Code at All)**
If the class **creates dependencies inside itself and you cannot change it**, you can use **reflection** to replace those dependencies in tests.  

#### **Example: Class with Hardcoded Dependencies**
```java
public class MyService {
    private final Dependency1 dependency1 = new Dependency1();

    public MyService() {
        String result = dependency1.getData();  // Hardcoded call in constructor
    }
}
```
#### **Test: Override `dependency1` Using Reflection**
```java
import java.lang.reflect.Field;

@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private Dependency1 mockDependency1;

    private MyService myService;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() throws Exception {
        myService = new MyService();

        Field field = MyService.class.getDeclaredField("dependency1");
        field.setAccessible(true);
        field.set(myService, mockDependency1);  // Replace hardcoded dependency

        when(mockDependency1.getData()).thenReturn("mocked data");
    }
}
```
✅ **Now the mock is injected, but reflection should be a last resort.**

## **Best Approach**  
| Approach | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| ✅ Constructor Injection (Best) | Simple, testable, follows SOLID principles | Requires modifying the constructor | Preferred for new code |
| ⚠️ `spy()` & `doReturn()` | Works for partially mocked objects | Doesn't work for final/private fields | If constructor injection isn’t possible |
| ❌ Reflection | Allows modifying private fields | Hacky, not maintainable | Last resort for legacy code |

Would you be able to modify the constructor, or are you working with legacy code? 🚀
