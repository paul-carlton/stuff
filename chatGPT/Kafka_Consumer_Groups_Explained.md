**Paul Carlton**: Explain Kafka groups

**ChatGPT**: In Apache Kafka, **consumer groups** are a fundamental concept used to achieve scalability, fault tolerance, and parallel processing of messages from Kafka topics. Here’s a detailed explanation:

### What is a Kafka Consumer Group?
A **consumer group** is a group of Kafka consumers that work together to consume messages from a topic. All consumers within the group share a common **group ID**, which is used to identify the group. A consumer group allows for parallel processing of messages while ensuring that each message is processed only once by one consumer in the group.

### Key Concepts of Kafka Consumer Groups

1. **Group ID**:  
   The unique identifier for a consumer group. Consumers with the same group ID belong to the same group.

2. **Partition Assignment**:  
   Kafka topics are divided into **partitions**, and within a consumer group, partitions are assigned to consumers so that each partition is consumed by only one consumer in the group.  
   - If there are more consumers than partitions, some consumers will be idle.  
   - If there are more partitions than consumers, some consumers will process multiple partitions.

3. **Message Delivery Semantics**:  
   Kafka ensures different levels of delivery guarantees for consumer groups:  
   - **At least once**: Each message will be processed at least once. This is the default.  
   - **At most once**: Messages may be missed but are never processed more than once.  
   - **Exactly once**: Each message is processed exactly once (with additional configuration like Kafka Streams or transactional producers/consumers).

4. **Offset Management**:  
   Consumers track their progress using **offsets**, which are unique identifiers for each message within a partition. Kafka stores these offsets in a special internal topic called `__consumer_offsets`.  
   - Each consumer in a group periodically commits its offset, so it knows where to resume if it restarts.

5. **Rebalancing**:  
   When the number of consumers or partitions in a group changes, Kafka triggers a **rebalance** to redistribute the partitions among the consumers. This ensures optimal resource utilization. However, rebalancing can cause temporary downtime, so minimizing its frequency is important.

6. **Fault Tolerance**:  
   If a consumer in the group fails, its assigned partitions are automatically reassigned to other active consumers in the group. This ensures uninterrupted processing.

### Example of Kafka Consumer Groups
- Suppose you have a topic with 4 partitions (`P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`) and a consumer group `group1` with 2 consumers (`C1`, `C2`). Kafka will distribute the partitions as follows:
  - `C1`: P0, P1  
  - `C2`: P2, P3  

  If a third consumer (`C3`) joins the group, Kafka will rebalance, and the new assignment might look like:
  - `C1`: P0  
  - `C2`: P1  
  - `C3`: P2, P3  

### Advantages of Kafka Consumer Groups
1. **Scalability**: Distributing partitions across multiple consumers allows for parallel processing.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: If a consumer fails, another consumer in the group takes over its partitions.
3. **Load Balancing**: Kafka automatically balances partitions among consumers when the group size changes.

### Practical Use Case
For example, in a log processing system:
- A Kafka topic contains log messages from various applications.
- A consumer group of 3 consumers reads and processes the logs in parallel.
- Each consumer processes a subset of the log data, ensuring efficient and fault-tolerant handling of logs.

**Paul Carlton**: Kafka Message Delivery Semantics

**ChatGPT**: Kafka provides three types of **message delivery semantics** to control how messages are delivered and processed. These are:

---

### 1. **At Most Once**
- Messages are delivered to the consumer **at most once**, meaning some messages may be missed, but no message will be delivered more than once.
- This occurs when:
  - Offsets are committed **before** processing the message.
  - If the consumer crashes after committing the offset but before processing, the message is lost.
- Use Case:
  - Scenarios where occasional message loss is acceptable (e.g., non-critical logging systems).

---

### 2. **At Least Once** (Default Behavior)
- Messages are delivered **at least once**, meaning no messages are missed, but duplicates may occur.
- This occurs when:
  - Offsets are committed **after** processing the message.
  - If the consumer crashes before committing the offset, the message will be reprocessed when the consumer restarts.
- Duplicates are possible if the processing operation is not idempotent (i.e., performing the same operation multiple times produces different results).
- Use Case:
  - Most general-purpose use cases where message loss is unacceptable, but duplicate handling is manageable.

---

### 3. **Exactly Once**
- Messages are delivered **exactly once**, meaning no messages are missed, and no duplicates occur.
- Kafka achieves this through:
  - **Idempotent Producers**: Ensures messages are written to Kafka only once.
  - **Transactional Producers and Consumers**: Guarantees that a batch of writes and reads is processed atomically.
  - **Kafka Streams**: Kafka's stream-processing library supports exactly-once semantics natively for stateful operations.
- Use Case:
  - Critical systems like financial transactions, inventory management, and billing systems where both message loss and duplication are unacceptable.

---

### Key Points to Consider
1. **Offset Management**:
   - Kafka consumers commit offsets to track their progress.
   - Where and when offsets are committed determines the message delivery semantics:
     - **At most once**: Commit offsets before processing.
     - **At least once**: Commit offsets after processing.
     - **Exactly once**: Use transactional APIs to commit offsets atomically.

2. **Trade-offs**:
   - **At Most Once**: Faster, but less reliable.
   - **At Least Once**: Reliable but may require duplicate handling in downstream systems.
   - **Exactly Once**: Reliable and no duplicates, but it introduces overhead (e.g., higher latency and additional configuration).

3. **Transactional Producer/Consumer**:
   - Requires enabling Kafka's transactional features and ensuring proper configuration for `enable.idempotence`, `transactional.id`, and `isolation.level`.

---

### Summary Table

| **Semantics**   | **Message Loss** | **Duplicates** | **Use Cases**                           |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **At Most Once** | Possible         | No             | Non-critical logging, monitoring.       |
| **At Least Once**| No               | Possible       | General-purpose systems.                |
| **Exactly Once** | No               | No             | Financial systems, inventory, billing.  |

Would you like an example or further clarification?

**Paul Carlton**: Is Kafka Message Delivery Semantics set per topic 

**ChatGPT**: No, **Kafka's message delivery semantics are not set at the topic level.** Instead, they are determined by the **configuration and behavior of producers, consumers, and brokers** involved in the Kafka ecosystem.

Here's a breakdown:

---

### **1. Message Delivery Semantics Determined by Producer**
- **At Most Once**:
  - The producer sends a message without retries and does not wait for acknowledgments (acks=0). If a failure occurs, the message is lost.
- **At Least Once**:
  - The producer retries sending messages if a failure occurs and ensures delivery but might create duplicates if retries succeed multiple times (e.g., `acks=1` or `acks=all` with retries enabled).
- **Exactly Once**:
  - The producer uses **idempotent mode** (enabled by setting `enable.idempotence=true`) to ensure each message is written to Kafka **exactly once**, even in the case of retries.
  - For transactional processing, the producer uses a `transactional.id` to group writes and achieve atomicity.

---

### **2. Message Delivery Semantics Determined by Consumer**
- The delivery semantics depend on how offsets are managed and committed by the consumer:
  - **At Most Once**: Offsets are committed before processing the message.
  - **At Least Once**: Offsets are committed after processing the message.
  - **Exactly Once**: Offsets are committed as part of a transaction using Kafka's **transactional API**.

---

### **3. Message Delivery Semantics Are Configurable Per Client**
- Semantics are configured **per producer or consumer**:
  - A producer can be configured for at-most-once, at-least-once, or exactly-once semantics independently of the consumer.
  - Similarly, a consumer can adopt at-most-once, at-least-once, or exactly-once behavior, regardless of the producer's configuration.

---

### **4. Broker Behavior**
- Kafka brokers facilitate the mechanics of delivery, but they do not directly enforce a specific delivery semantic. For example:
  - Message durability depends on replication (e.g., acks=all ensures all replicas acknowledge the message).
  - Broker features like idempotency and transactions enable exactly-once delivery but must be explicitly configured at the client level.

---

### **Example**
- A Kafka topic might simultaneously have:
  - **Producer A** sending messages with **at-most-once** semantics.
  - **Producer B** sending messages with **exactly-once** semantics.
  - **Consumer Group C** consuming messages with **at-least-once** semantics.
  - **Consumer Group D** consuming messages with **exactly-once** semantics.

Thus, the message delivery semantics are determined by how the **producer writes**, the **broker replicates**, and the **consumer reads and commits offsets**, not by the topic itself.

**Paul Carlton**: Tell me about Kafka streams 

**ChatGPT**: **Kafka Streams** is a powerful and lightweight **stream processing library** provided by Apache Kafka. It enables developers to build real-time applications and microservices that process data streams stored in Kafka topics. Unlike other stream processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Flink or Spark), Kafka Streams is a library that runs within your application, making it simple to use and deploy.

---

### **Key Features of Kafka Streams**

1. **Stream Processing**:
   - Kafka Streams processes data in **real-time** as it flows through Kafka topics.
   - Supports **stateless operations** (e.g., filtering, mapping) and **stateful operations** (e.g., joins, aggregations).

2. **Built-In Fault Tolerance**:
   - Kafka Streams automatically handles **fault tolerance** using Kafka's replication and partitioning mechanisms.
   - State information is stored in **local state stores** backed by a Kafka topic, ensuring recovery after failure.

3. **Scalable and Distributed**:
   - Kafka Streams distributes processing across multiple application instances, with each instance processing a subset of partitions.
   - Scaling is as simple as adding more application instances.

4. **Exactly Once Processing**:
   - Kafka Streams natively supports **exactly-once semantics** by leveraging **Kafka transactions** and idempotent producers.

5. **Integration with Kafka**:
   - Tight integration with Kafka topics, making it easy to consume from and produce to Kafka.
   - Uses Kafka for data storage, fault tolerance, and horizontal scaling.

6. **Event-Driven Applications**:
   - Ideal for building event-driven architectures and stream-processing applications.

7. **Developer-Friendly**:
   - Provides a simple, high-level DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for defining stream processing pipelines.
   - Also supports a lower-level **Processor API** for advanced use cases.

---

### **Core Concepts of Kafka Streams**

1. **Stream**:
   - An **unbounded, continuous flow of data** records, represented as a Kafka topic.

2. **Stream Processor**:
   - The computational unit in Kafka Streams that processes records from a stream. Processors are connected to form a **processing topology**.

3. **Stream-Table Duality**:
   - Kafka Streams treats topics as both **streams** (events) and **tables** (state). This allows flexible operations like joins between streams and tables.

4. **State Stores**:
   - Used for maintaining state during processing (e.g., counts, aggregations).
   - State is stored locally and backed by Kafka for fault tolerance.

5. **Topologies**:
   - A directed graph of processors and streams that defines how data flows and is processed.

---

### **Common Operations in Kafka Streams**

1. **Stateless Transformations**:
   - Examples: `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`.
   - Operate on each record independently.

2. **Stateful Transformations**:
   - Examples: `aggregate`, `reduce`, `count`, `join`.
   - Require maintaining state (e.g., for tracking counts or performing joins).

3. **Windowing**:
   - Used to group records into time windows for processing.
   - Examples: Tumbling windows, sliding windows, session windows.

4. **Joins**:
   - Joins can be performed between streams, or between a stream and a table.
   - Examples: `stream-stream join`, `stream-table join`.

5. **Aggregation**:
   - Operations like summing, counting, or averaging over a key.

---

### **How Kafka Streams Works**

1. **Input**: 
   - Reads data from Kafka topics.
2. **Processing**: 
   - Applies transformations, aggregations, and joins using a processing topology.
3. **State Management**:
   - Stores intermediate results locally in **RocksDB** (embedded key-value store), backed by Kafka.
4. **Output**: 
   - Writes processed results to Kafka topics or external systems.

---

### **Example: Word Count in Kafka Streams**
```java
StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

// Read from the input topic
KStream<String, String> inputStream = builder.stream("input-topic");

// Perform word count
KTable<String, Long> wordCounts = inputStream
    .flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
    .groupBy((key, word) -> word)
    .count();

// Write the results to the output topic
wordCounts.toStream().to("output-topic", Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long()));

// Build and start the stream
KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), config);
streams.start();
```

---

### **Use Cases for Kafka Streams**
1. **Real-Time Analytics**:
   - Process events in real-time, such as monitoring metrics or analyzing logs.
2. **ETL Pipelines**:
   - Transform, filter, and enrich data as it flows through Kafka.
3. **Event-Driven Applications**:
   - Build microservices that react to real-time events.
4. **Fraud Detection**:
   - Detect patterns in transaction streams to flag fraudulent activity.
5. **Personalization**:
   - Provide personalized content based on real-time user behavior.

---

### **Advantages of Kafka Streams**
- No need for additional infrastructure; runs as part of the application.
- Built-in integration with Kafka.
- Simple to scale and deploy.
- Supports fault-tolerant, distributed, and real-time processing.

### **Limitations**
- Limited to Kafka as the data source and sink.
- May not be as feature-rich as specialized stream processing systems like Apache Flink or Apache Spark for complex batch/stream processing use cases.

**Paul Carlton**: Can confluent-kafka support active active across multiple data centres 

**ChatGPT**: Yes, **Confluent Kafka** supports active-active deployment across multiple data centers using **Confluent Replicator** or **Cluster Linking** for replication, along with Kafka's native multi-cluster features. These tools enable active-active setups where applications in different data centers can write to and read from Kafka clusters, ensuring high availability, disaster recovery, and global data synchronization.

Here's a breakdown of how Confluent Kafka enables active-active across multiple data centers:

---

### **Key Features Supporting Active-Active Deployment**

1. **Cluster Linking (Recommended)**:
   - Available in Confluent Platform, **Cluster Linking** allows Kafka clusters in different data centers to directly replicate topics and metadata without requiring external connectors.
   - Enables **low-latency replication** and ensures consistency between clusters.
   - Both clusters can act as producers and consumers, making them truly active-active.
   - Changes made in one cluster are mirrored to the other in real-time.

2. **Confluent Replicator**:
   - A Kafka Connect-based tool that replicates data between clusters, enabling active-active configurations.
   - Supports **bi-directional replication**, allowing both clusters to produce and consume messages.
   - Handles schema replication when integrated with the **Confluent Schema Registry**.

3. **Global Topic Access**:
   - Topics can be synchronized across clusters in real-time, making data produced in one data center available in others.
   - You can use **prefixes or topic naming conventions** to avoid data conflicts.

4. **Confluent Schema Registry**:
   - Ensures that schemas for data are consistent across clusters, enabling smooth communication in an active-active setup.

5. **Transactional Messaging**:
   - With **idempotent producers** and **exactly-once semantics**, Confluent Kafka ensures that messages are not duplicated or lost even in active-active deployments.

6. **Multi-Cluster Management**:
   - **Confluent Control Center** simplifies managing multiple clusters across data centers, monitoring health, and ensuring smooth replication.

---

### **Challenges in Active-Active Deployments and Solutions**

1. **Data Conflicts**:
   - In active-active setups, if both clusters accept writes to the same topic and partition, there is a risk of data collisions.
   - **Solution**:
     - Use topic partitioning strategies to divide the write workload between clusters.
     - Use global IDs or event versioning to track changes.

2. **Latency**:
   - Latency can increase when replicating data across geographically distant data centers.
   - **Solution**:
     - Use **Cluster Linking**, which offers low-latency replication by bypassing Kafka Connect.
     - Deploy producers and consumers close to the cluster they primarily interact with.

3. **Consistency Guarantees**:
   - Replication across clusters introduces challenges with message ordering and consistency.
   - **Solution**:
     - Use transactional producers to ensure **exactly-once semantics**.
     - Design for eventual consistency if strict ordering across clusters is not required.

4. **Network Partitioning**:
   - If the network connection between data centers fails, clusters may diverge.
   - **Solution**:
     - Implement **conflict resolution logic** for merging data after reconnection.
     - Use replication tools like Confluent Replicator or Cluster Linking to synchronize data automatically.

---

### **Active-Active Architecture Example**

1. **Multi-Cluster Setup**:
   - Two Kafka clusters, one in Data Center A (Cluster A) and one in Data Center B (Cluster B).
   - Both clusters have producers and consumers interacting with local topics.

2. **Replication**:
   - Use **Cluster Linking** or **Confluent Replicator** for bi-directional replication.
   - Topics like `orders_A` and `orders_B` handle data from their respective clusters, and a global topic `orders_global` aggregates data across both.

3. **Failover**:
   - In case of failure in one data center, applications can seamlessly switch to the other cluster.

4. **Use of Schema Registry**:
   - A centralized or replicated Schema Registry ensures consistent schemas for producers and consumers across clusters.

---

### **Benefits of Active-Active with Confluent Kafka**
- **High Availability**: Applications can continue working even if one cluster is unavailable.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Data is always replicated to another cluster.
- **Global Data Distribution**: Real-time synchronization of data across geographically dispersed data centers.
- **Load Balancing**: Spread read and write workloads across clusters to reduce latency and increase throughput.

---

### **Tools for Active-Active Kafka Deployment**

1. **Cluster Linking**:
   - Lightweight, low-latency replication.
   - Ideal for real-time synchronization between clusters.

2. **Confluent Replicator**:
   - Flexible replication with advanced filtering and transformation capabilities.

3. **Confluent Control Center**:
   - For monitoring and managing active-active deployments.

4. **Confluent Schema Registry**:
   - Ensures schema consistency across clusters.

---

### **Is Kafka Itself Active-Active?**
While Kafka can operate in **active-passive** (e.g., MirrorMaker 2 for failover) or **active-active** modes (using Confluent tools), it requires careful design to ensure conflict resolution, consistency, and replication logic in active-active setups.

Would you like help setting up a specific active-active architecture or troubleshooting an issue?

**Paul Carlton**: Can open source kafka support active active across multiple data centres 

**ChatGPT**: Open-source Apache Kafka **does not natively support active-active deployments** across multiple data centers out of the box. However, you can achieve an active-active architecture with **careful design and configuration** using tools like **MirrorMaker 2** (included with Apache Kafka) and additional strategies for replication and conflict management.

Here’s how you can set up **active-active Kafka** using open-source components:

---

### **1. Multi-Cluster Setup with MirrorMaker 2**
Apache Kafka includes **MirrorMaker 2** (MM2), which enables **bi-directional replication** between clusters in different data centers. This allows each Kafka cluster to replicate data to the other, enabling both clusters to act as producers and consumers.

#### Key Features of MirrorMaker 2:
- **Bi-Directional Replication**: Allows both clusters to replicate data in real-time.
- **Topic Prefixing**: MM2 adds prefixes to replicated topics (e.g., `dc1.topicA`, `dc2.topicA`) to avoid naming conflicts.
- **Automatic Offset Syncing**: Ensures offsets are aligned between clusters for seamless consumer failover.

#### Limitations:
- **No Built-In Conflict Resolution**: If both clusters write to the same topic and partition, conflicts can arise.
- **Higher Latency**: Cross-data-center replication can add significant latency compared to native tools like Confluent's Cluster Linking.

---

### **2. Strategies for Active-Active Deployment**

To make open-source Kafka work in an active-active mode, you'll need to address key challenges like **data conflicts, consistency, and replication latency**:

#### a) **Partitioned Writes**
- Use partitioning to route writes to specific clusters.
- For example:
  - Cluster A handles writes for keys `0-499`.
  - Cluster B handles writes for keys `500-999`.
- MirrorMaker replicates data, but each cluster processes only its assigned keys, avoiding conflicts.

#### b) **Prefix-Based Topic Segmentation**
- Configure MM2 to replicate topics with prefixes (e.g., `dc1.orders` and `dc2.orders`).
- Applications can merge or process data from both topics as needed.

#### c) **Conflict Resolution**
- Implement application-level logic to resolve conflicts (e.g., using timestamps or version numbers).
- For example:
  - Retain the latest update based on a timestamp.
  - Merge updates when possible.

#### d) **Eventual Consistency**
- Open-source Kafka can only guarantee **eventual consistency** in active-active setups.
- Design applications to handle out-of-order or duplicate messages due to replication delays.

---

### **3. Consumer Failover Across Clusters**
Consumers in active-active setups must be able to switch between clusters if one fails. You can achieve this by:

1. **Offset Syncing**:
   - MirrorMaker 2 syncs offsets between clusters.
   - This allows consumers to resume reading from the same point in the replicated cluster.

2. **Client Configuration**:
   - Configure Kafka clients with multiple bootstrap servers (e.g., from both clusters).
   - If one cluster is unavailable, the client connects to the other.

---

### **4. Monitoring and Management**
In an active-active setup, monitoring and managing multiple clusters is critical. Use open-source tools like:
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: For Kafka cluster metrics (e.g., lag, replication throughput).
- **Kafka Manager**: To monitor topics, partitions, and replication status.

---

### **Limitations of Open-Source Kafka in Active-Active Deployments**
While it is possible to achieve active-active setups, there are significant limitations compared to commercial tools like Confluent's **Cluster Linking**:
1. **Replication Overhead**:
   - MM2 requires running Kafka Connect, which introduces operational complexity.
2. **Conflict Management**:
   - Open-source Kafka does not provide built-in mechanisms for handling data conflicts.
3. **Latency**:
   - MM2 replication is slower compared to Confluent's Cluster Linking.
4. **Complexity**:
   - You must design and implement conflict resolution and partitioning logic manually.

---

### **When to Use Open-Source Kafka for Active-Active**
- You want a cost-effective solution and have the resources to manage the complexity.
- Your use case can tolerate eventual consistency and some additional latency.
- You do not need strict **exactly-once semantics** across clusters.

---

### Example Open-Source Active-Active Architecture with MM2

1. **Clusters**:
   - Cluster 1: Data Center A
   - Cluster 2: Data Center B

2. **Replication**:
   - Set up MirrorMaker 2 for bi-directional replication:
     - Prefix `dc1.` for topics in Cluster 1.
     - Prefix `dc2.` for topics in Cluster 2.

3. **Producers**:
   - Produce locally to the nearest Kafka cluster.

4. **Consumers**:
   - Consume from local topics.
   - In case of failure, consume from replicated topics.

---

### Summary: Can Open-Source Kafka Support Active-Active?
Yes, but with **caveats**:
- Active-active is achievable using **MirrorMaker 2** for replication.
- You need to handle **conflict resolution, latency, and eventual consistency** manually.
- The solution is not as seamless or feature-rich as Confluent's **Cluster Linking**.

Would you like details on configuring MirrorMaker 2 or strategies for conflict resolution?

**Paul Carlton**: Explain ReactiveCouchbase

**ChatGPT**: **ReactiveCouchbase** is a reactive, non-blocking client library for interacting with **Couchbase**, a NoSQL database. It integrates reactive programming principles, typically using frameworks like **RxJava** or **Reactor**, to handle asynchronous data operations efficiently.

        return "127.0.0.1"; // Couchbase server address
    }

    @Override
    public String getUserName() {
        return "admin"; // Couchbase username
    }

    @Override
    public String getPassword() {
        return "password"; // Couchbase password
    }

    @Override
    public String getBucketName() {
        return "my_bucket"; // Couchbase bucket name
    }
}
```

---

### **Model Class**

Define an entity to map to Couchbase documents. Annotate it with `@Document`.

```java
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;
import org.springframework.data.couchbase.core.mapping.Document;
import lombok.Data;

@Data
@Document
public class User {

    @Id
    private String id; // Unique document ID
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private int age;
}
```

---

### **Repository Interface**

Create a repository interface by extending `CouchbaseRepository`.

```java
import org.springframework.data.couchbase.repository.CouchbaseRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

import java.util.List;

@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends CouchbaseRepository<User, String> {
    // Custom query method
    List<User> findByAgeGreaterThan(int age);
}
```

---

### **Service Layer**

Create a service layer to handle business logic.

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import java.util.List;

@Service
public class UserService {

    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public User createUser(User user) {
        return userRepository.save(user);
    }

    public User getUserById(String id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);
    }

    public List<User> getUsersOlderThan(int age) {
        return userRepository.findByAgeGreaterThan(age);
    }

    public void deleteUser(String id) {
        userRepository.deleteById(id);
    }
}
```

---

### **Controller**

Create a REST controller to expose the endpoints.

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    private final UserService userService;

    public UserController(UserService userService) {
        this.userService = userService;
    }

    @PostMapping
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        return userService.createUser(user);
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUserById(@PathVariable String id) {
        return userService.getUserById(id);
    }

    @GetMapping("/older-than/{age}")
    public List<User> getUsersOlderThan(@PathVariable int age) {
        return userService.getUsersOlderThan(age);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteUser(@PathVariable String id) {
        userService.deleteUser(id);
    }
}
```

---

### **Running the Application**

1. Start your **Couchbase server** and ensure the bucket (`my_bucket`) is created.
2. Run the Spring Boot application.
3. Use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to interact with the REST API.

---

### **Example API Calls**

1. **Create a User**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/users \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"id": "user1", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com", "age": 30}'
   ```

2. **Get a User by ID**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/users/user1
   ```

3. **Get Users Older Than a Certain Age**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/users/older-than/25
   ```

4. **Delete a User**
   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/users/user1
   ```

### **Conclusion**
This example demonstrates how to integrate **Couchbase** with **Spring Boot** to build a simple CRUD REST API. By leveraging **Spring Data Couchbase**, you can abstract much of the boilerplate for database operations while enjoying features like custom queries and repository interfaces. 

Would you like help with advanced features, such as N1QL queries, reactive programming, or Couchbase event handling?
