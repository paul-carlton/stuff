# TIOBE Index for January 2025

### January Headline: Python is TIOBE's programming language of the year 2024!

Programming language Python has won the title "TIOBE's programming language of the year 2024". This award is given to the programming language with the highest increase in ratings in one year time. Python gained a whopping 9.3% in 2024. This is far ahead of its competition: Java +2.3%, JavaScript +1.4% and Go +1.2%. Python is everywhere nowadays, and it is the undisputed default language of choice in many fields. It might even become the language with the highest ranking ever in the TIOBE index. Python's only serious drawbacks are (and thus leaving room for competition) its lack of performance and that most errors occur run-time. 

Apart from this, two interesting things happened in the TIOBE index top 10 in 2024. The C language lost a lot of popularity and was surpassed by C++ and Java. The main reason for this is that C is replaced by C++ in a lot of embedded software systems. Java and C++ are currently fighthing for the top 2 position. The other interesting thing is that PHP said a final farewell to the top 10 and is replaced by Go, which is a top 10 keeper. 

Lots of eyes were on Rust and Kotlin this year. Did they live up to their promises in 2024? Rust is still getting more popular. Despite the amazing speed of Rust programs, its steep learning curve will never make it become the lingua franca of the common programmer unfortunately. Kotlin, on the other hand, disappointed: it didn't break through and even lost (possibly permanently) its top 20 position in 2024. 

Further down the list we see two new promising languages: Rust's competitor Zig climbed from #149 to #61 in 2024, whereas Mojo, the faster Python, jumped from position #194 to #68. Especially Mojo, which was first released only 2 years ago, addresses exactly what is needed in the programming field. I have high hopes that it will get close to a top 20 position in 2025.

The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sites Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.

The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.

(Visual) Basic--54 5 4 4 3 5 4  

There are 2 important remarks here:

  * There is a difference between "Visual Basic" and "(Visual) Basic" in the table above. Until 2010, "(Visual) Basic" referred to all possible dialects of Basic, including Visual Basic. After some discussion, it has been decided to split "(Visual) Basic" into all its dialects such as Visual Basic .NET, Classic Visual Basic, PureBasic, and Small Basic, just to name a few. Since Visual Basic .NET has become the major implementation of Visual Basic, it is now called "Visual Basic".
  * The programming language SQL was added to the TIOBE index in 2018 after somebody pointed out that SQL is Turing Complete. So although this language is very old, it has only a short history in the index.

## Bugs & Change Requests

This is the top 5 of most requested changes and bugs. If you have any suggestions how to improve the index don’t hesitate to send an e-mail to tpci@tiobe.com.

  1. Apart from “<language> programming”, also other queries such as “programming with <language>”, “<language> development” and “<language> coding” should be tried out.
  2. Add queries for other natural languages (apart from English). The idea is to start with the Chinese search engine Baidu. This has been implemented partially and will be completed the next few months.
  3. Add a list of all search term requests that have been rejected. This is to minimize the number of recurring mails about Rails, JQuery, JSP, etc.
  4. Start a TIOBE index for databases, software configuration management systems and application frameworks.
  5. Some search engines allow to query pages that have been added last year. The TIOBE index should only track those recently added pages.

###  Am I allowed to show the TIOBE index in my weblog/presentation/publication?

Yes, the only condition is to refer to its original source “www.tiobe.com”.

###  How may I nominate a new language to be added to the TIOBE index?

If a language meets the criteria of being listed (i.e. it is Turing complete and has an own Wikipedia entry that indicates that it concerns a programming language) and it is sufficiently popular (more than 5,000 hits for +”<language> programming” for Google), then please write an e-mail to tpci@tiobe.com.

###  I would like to have the complete data set of the TIOBE index. Is this possible?

We spent a lot of effort to obtain all the data and keep the TIOBE index up to date. In order to compensate a bit for this, we ask a fee of 5,000 US$ for the complete data set. The data set runs from June 2001 till today. It started with 25 languages back in 2001, and now measures more than 150 languages once a month. The data are available in comma separated format. Please contact sales@tiobe.com for more information.

###  Why is the maximum taken to calculate the ranking for a grouping, why not the sum?

Well, you can do it either way and both are wrong. If you take the sum, then you get the intersection twice. If you take the max, then you miss the difference. Which one to choose? Suppose somebody comes up with a new search term that is 10% of the original. If you take the max, nothing changes. If you take the sum then the ratings will rise 10%. So taking the sum will be an incentive for some to come up with all kinds of obscure terms for a language. That’s why we decided to take the max.

The proper way to solve this is is of course to take the sum and subtract the intersection. This will give rise to an explosion of extra queries that must be performed. Suppose a language has a grouping of 15 terms, then you have to perform 32,768 queries (all combinations of intersections). So this seems not possible either… If somebody has a solution for this, please let us know.

As of 2024, JavaScript and HTML/CSS were the most commonly used programming languages among software developers around the world, with more than 62 percent of respondents stating that they used JavaScript and just around 53 percent using HTML/CSS. Python, SQL, and TypeScript rounded out the top five most widely used programming languages around the world.   

## Programming languages 

At a very basic level, programming languages serve as sets of instructions that direct computers on how to behave and carry out tasks. Thanks to the increased prevalence of, and reliance on, computers and electronic devices in today’s society, these languages play a crucial role in the everyday lives of people around the world. An increasing number of people are interested in furthering their understanding of these tools through courses and bootcamps, while current developers are constantly seeking new languages and resources to learn to add to their skills. Furthermore, programming knowledge is becoming an important skill to possess within various industries throughout the business world. Job seekers with skills in Python, R, and SQL will find their knowledge to be among the most highly desirable data science skills and likely assist in their search for employment.

# What are the Most Popular Programming Languages?

  * Kate Devlin 
  * March 29, 2023

 

popular computer languages 

It is estimated that there are hundreds of programming languages in use today. Whether you are already working in IT or looking to get into the field, you may be curious about which programs are currently trending and which ones are most in demand. A quick online search will produce numerous articles, lists, and indexes touting the latest statistics, trends, and predictions. 

To help you in your search, here are three resources worth checking out: the TIOBE Index, the PYPL Index, and Stack Overflow’s annual developer survey.

The TIOBE Index and the PYPL Index both monitor and track the use of programming languages around the world and show you what’s trending—both up and down. Stack Overflow’s annual survey offers insights and views straight from developers themselves—more than 70,000—on various aspects of working in IT and what tools and programs they’re using and learning.

Let’s take a closer look at these three resources.

The TIOBE Index

The TIOBE index tracks the popularity of programming languages on a monthly basis and gathers data based on search queries by skilled engineers, training courses, and vendors, worldwide. Data from the 25 most popular search engines—Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Wikipedia, Amazon, YouTube, and Baidu, to name a few—is used to calculate the different rankings.

The TIOBE index reports on the most popular languages, but it does not report on what the best language is or which language has been used to write the most lines of code. The index ranks up to the top 100 languages, but it gives the most details on the top 20—like yearly comparisons and up and down changes in rankings.

Currently, the top four programming languages on the index are Python, C, Java, and C++. No matter where you are on your IT career path, the TIOBE index can help you see what is currently in demand and what you may want to focus on.

Popularity of Programming Language (PYPL) Index

The PYPL index is another index worth looking at. This index is created from analyzing how many times language tutorials are searched on Google and comes from analyzing raw data from Google Trends. The site shows the top 28 languages and their rankings. Similar to TIOBE, it shows current rankings as well as yearly changes in rank.

PYPL also offers a feature that lets you see how popular a language is worldwide or in a particular country. If you’re interested in even more data, they offer three other indexes.

According to PYPL, the four top programming languages right now are Python, Java, JavaScript, and C#, with Python being the most popular language worldwide. The PYPL index is another valuable tool in your job search.

Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow also gathers data, but their numbers are based on an annual survey of thousands of developers from all around the world. With more than 70,000 respondents, Stack Overflow’s survey provides an in-depth look into a variety of categories—all from a developer’s point of view. Categories include developer profiles, most popular languages, programs and tools they’re currently using, want to use, or dislike using, and what they’re learning to code. 

According to Stack Overflow, JavaScript has been the most commonly used programming language for 10 years in a row. However, for those developers currently learning to code, the most popular programs are currently Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. 

Stack Overflow’s annual survey is worth a look if you want an in-depth perspective and opinions from those in the field right now. As with the two indexes, these survey results can help you on your quest for information and which programming language—or languages—to pursue.

Languages in 2023 and beyond

No one really knows what the more popular programming languages will be in 2023, but it’s safe to assume that many of the current popular ones will continue to be so—Python, JavaScript, Java, C++—but stay tuned to see what makes its way up and down the charts—you may be surprised. Some making their way up the charts this year already include Go, Rust, Ruby, TypeScript, Dart, Lua, Julia, and Scratch, in addition to several others.

At TMF, we are always looking for candidates skilled in not only the popular and in-demand languages like Python and JavaScript but also the more mature ones like COBOL that have been around for a while and are still in use today. Contact us or check out our current job listings for a list of available programming roles.

## Choosing a Programming Language

### When Your Project Has Specific Requirements

In some cases, your project’s technical requirements will determine which language to proceed with. For example, if the project is AI/ML-based, then it may be a clear decision to use Python, or if you are building an iOS application, then Swift might be the most well-suited.

Business constraints may also dictate which language to use for your project. If your existing team already is proficient in a programming language, you will likely want to select the same language to save time on team catch-up or hiring of new developers.

Similarly, if you are extending an existing system written in a programming language, it is advised to choose the same language, assuming it is considered relevant and modern.

### If Your Project Doesn’t Have Specific Requirements

If you are developing your project from scratch, you’ll likely have flexibility in choosing a language since you may not have specific requirements you must follow. With many languages to choose from, we can help you narrow down which ones will work best for your project.

Often, multiple programming languages can be equally suitable for developing an application. For instance, a backend application could be implemented using Java, .NET, or Node.js, while a web front-end might involve choosing between JavaScript and TypeScript. In such cases, we evaluate factors like the availability of skilled developers, the specific needs of the project, and the long-term maintainability of the chosen technology.

## Using Multiple Languages

Using multiple programming languages in a project has several advantages. It allows developers to select the most appropriate language for specific tasks, which can lead to more efficient and effective development. This approach also provides opportunities for developers to expand their skillsets and increases hiring flexibility by enabling access to a broader pool of talent with expertise in different languages.

However, there are also challenges to consider. Using multiple languages can increase the complexity of a project, requiring more maintenance and potentially leading to incompatibilities between tools or libraries. It can also make standardization across applications more difficult, which is essential for smooth operation and long-term maintenance.

## Aspects to Consider in a Programming Language

Whether you're developing a new project from scratch or extending an existing system, we can help you select a language that suits the needs of your project. Following a discovery phase, we will analyze your context and technical & business requirements, and with consideration of your resources, we’ll propose the optimal technologies for your project.

### Additional aspects to consider when deciding on a programming language:

Language-domain match: See what others in your field are doing to resolve a similar problem domain or by looking at some code that resolves issues you’re likely to have.

Maturity of the Language: If a language has a library that solves your domain problem, it might be worth it to put up with some flaws in the language. Additionally, more mature languages may have more reference material to draw on and more collaborators.

Efficiency: Efficient compilers or interpreters are what make languages “fast.” It can be important to review the interpreters or compilers for your language to make sure it is efficient.

Your Current Team: Consider the skills and expertise of the people you already have on your team who are available to work on the project.

Availability of Developers: It's important to consider the reliability and popularity of the language, as well as the availability of developers on the market who are familiar with it. Keep in mind that hiring may be easier and less costly for languages that are oversaturated with developers in comparison to lesser-used, outdated, or unpopular languages.

If you are seeking hard-to-hire programmers, Softjourn has skilled developers knowledgeable in .NET, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, React Native, React, and many other languages, who can help extend your team.

Project size: Are you looking to create a complex piece of software or something simple? At the end of the day, choose a language that you will have sufficient support with. 

The Tools and Libraries Available: Consider the availability of tools and libraries for languages as they can greatly facilitate the development process and provide access to a wide range of functionality.
