**ChatGPT**: search("Wicked London stage show how does it compare with the film ")

**ChatGPT**: The London stage production of "Wicked" and its film adaptation share the same foundational narrative but differ in several key aspects:

**Visual Design and Rights:**
The stage musical was restricted from referencing visual elements from the 1939 film "The Wizard of Oz" due to rights limitations. Consequently, iconic items like the ruby slippers and certain character designs are absent from the stage version. citeturn0search0 In contrast, the film adaptation had broader rights access, allowing for more direct visual references to the original film.

**Narrative Structure and Content:**
The film adaptation is divided into two parts, with the first installment released in November 2024. This division allows for a more in-depth exploration of the story and characters. The film introduces new characters and scenes not present in the stage version, such as Elphaba's childhood experiences and her tutoring sessions with Madame Morrible. Additionally, certain musical numbers have been expanded or reimagined for the screen. citeturn0search34

**Performance and Direction:**
The film's director, Jon M. Chu, emphasized a more intimate portrayal of characters, utilizing close-up shots to capture nuanced emotions, a technique not possible in live theater. This approach offers audiences a deeper emotional connection to the characters compared to the stage production. citeturn0news29

In summary, while both the London stage show and the film adaptation of "Wicked" tell the same overarching story, they offer distinct experiences through differences in visual design, narrative depth, and emotional portrayal. 

**Paul Carlton**: How can a GitHub commit be part of more than one pull request 

**ChatGPT**: A GitHub commit can be part of multiple pull requests (PRs) in several ways:

### 1. **Branch-Based Inclusion**
   - If a commit exists in a branch that is later used as the base for multiple PRs, it will appear in each of those PRs.
   - Example:
     1. You create `feature-branch` from `main` and commit `A`.
     2. You open PR #1 from `feature-branch` to `main`.
     3. You later create `new-feature-branch` from `feature-branch` (which contains commit `A`) and open PR #2 from `new-feature-branch` to `main`.
     4. Commit `A` appears in both PR #1 and PR #2.

### 2. **Cherry-Picking**
   - You manually apply the same commit to another branch using:
     ```sh
     git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
     ```
   - If you then create a PR from this second branch, the commit appears in both PRs.

### 3. **Rebasing**
   - If you rebase a branch onto another, shared commits will appear in both PRs.
   - Example:
     - You have `feature-branch` with commits A, B, and C.
     - You create a PR from `feature-branch` to `main`.
     - You later rebase `feature-branch` onto another branch (`other-feature-branch`) and open a PR from `other-feature-branch` to `main`.
     - Commits A, B, and C appear in both PRs.

### 4. **Merging a Branch That Is Already Part of Another PR**
   - If a PR is opened from a branch that already includes commits from another branch with an open PR, those commits will appear in both.

### 5. **Stacked Pull Requests**
   - Developers sometimes use stacked PRs where each PR builds on top of another.
   - Example:
     - PR #1 is opened with commit A.
     - PR #2 is opened from the same branch but contains additional commits (A and B).
     - Until PR #1 is merged, commit A will be visible in both PRs.

### **Final Outcome**
Once a PR is merged, GitHub automatically updates other open PRs based on their branch ancestry, potentially removing already merged commits from their diffs.
